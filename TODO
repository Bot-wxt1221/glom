libgda 3.0:
  * Probably, escape stuff needs to be fixed in glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc, glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc and/or glom/libglom/data_structure/field(types).cc because escaping policy changed from libgda 1 to libgda 2.

  * glom/mode_design/fields/box_db_table_definition.cc:590: There is a Gnome::Gda::TransactionIsolation parameter I have absolutely no clue about. We should either find out what it is supposed to do and/or provide some reasonable default in libgdamm.

  * Creating databases (frame_glom.cc, create_database()) sometimes fails due to the source database "template1" already being in use. A two-second-sleep seems to have improved chance that it works, but it is a) still not really reliable and b) a damn hack
