libgda 3.0:
  * Probably, escape stuff needs to be fixed in glom/libglom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc, glom/utility_widgets/imageglom.cc and/or glom/libglom/data_structure/field(types).cc because escaping policy changed from libgda 1 to libgda 2.

  * glom/mode_design/fields/box_db_table_definition.cc:590: There is a Gnome::Gda::TransactionIsolation parameter I have absolutely no clue about. We should either find out what it is supposed to do and/or provide some reasonable default in libgdamm.
