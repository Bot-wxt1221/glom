Large, independent, tasks:
- UI for administration of postgres users.
- Add ability to have calculation fields, if Postgres can do that.
- Add ability to translate table titles and field titles.

Document/Database linking:
-  Offer only "existing" document when not in developer mode.
- Automatically save changes (when in developer mode) without asking.

User Level:
- Do not allow developer mode if the postgres permissions are low.



Data:
- Properly handle NULL values in non-text fields. (maybe done already)
- Details: Use groups of fields.



Bugs:


- Data Mode: Details tab: Finish 'Related Records' Notebook page.
- Find Mode: Use Data layouts.
- Reports Mode: Add a 'Reports' mode.
- Users Mode: How do we get access info programmatically?



Fields:
- Indexed [X].
- View fields from relationship.
- Choices - static lists and from relationships.
  style:
    - Popup = ENUM
    - Checkboxes = SET
- Calculated fields:
  - Only when viewed?
  - Look at gnumeric - maybe there's an engine that I can take or be inspired by.
  - Look at MySQL SELECT functions
- Group field types - Use a combo that pops up a tree.


Future functionality:
Tools menu:
  Store database structure in document - this would allow example docs to say 'create database?'.
  Import/Export data.
  Show structure: graphical view of tables and their relationships.
  Export to Web: UI via HTML + JSP + JDBC.
  Moon on a stick.
