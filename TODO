Large, independent, tasks:
- UI for administration of postgres users.
- Add ability to have calculation fields, if Postgres can do that.
- Add ability to translate table titles and field titles.

Little tasks:
- Make the Details view (FlowTable) look different when in developer mode.
  (Add lines around the HBoxes.)
- Allow editing of the Details view by drag-and-drop, right-clicking (like Glade),
  as well as the current treeview hierarchy.

  
User Level:
- Do not allow developer mode if the postgres permissions are low.





Bugs:


- Data Mode: Details tab: Finish 'Related Records' Notebook page - put it in a separate tab.
- Reports Mode: Add a 'Reports' mode.
- Users Mode: How do we get access info programmatically?



Fields:
- Indexed [X].
- boolean
- View fields from relationship.
- Choices - static lists and from relationships.
  style:
    - Popup = ENUM
    - Checkboxes = SET
- Calculated fields:
  - Only when viewed?
  - Look at gnumeric - maybe there's an engine that I can take or be inspired by.
  - Look at MySQL SELECT functions
- Group field types - Use a combo that pops up a tree.


Future functionality:
Tools menu:
  Store database structure in document - this would allow example docs to say 'create database?'.
  Import/Export data.
  Show structure: graphical view of tables and their relationships.
  Export to Web: UI via HTML + JSP + JDBC.
  Moon on a stick.
