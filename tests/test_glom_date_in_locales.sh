# This test checks that dates are presented and interpreted correctly.
# That sometimes requires a translation of the %x date format in the .po file,
# and that translation is often lost accidentally
#
# This test requires these locales to be installed and configured.
# That might be a problem on some systems, so feel free to use a patch to edit this file or disable it altogether.
#
# These are chosen based on problems found previously,
# and the ones with good translations shown here: http://l10n.gnome.org/module/glom/
