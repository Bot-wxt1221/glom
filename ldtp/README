To run all the tests, simply execute

	ldtprunner test.xml

This produces a glom-test-log.xml log file with the test results. To run a
single test, simply launch the corresponding python script, such as

	database-creation/self-hosted.py

To add a new test, create a corresponding python script file and it to the
list in test.xml.
