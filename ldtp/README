To run all the tests, simply execute

	ldtprunner test.xml

This produces a glom-test-log.xml log file with the test results. To run a
single test, simply launch the corresponding python script, such as

	database-creation/self-hosted.py

Make sure to execute all scripts from the glom/ldtp directory, they might not
find required files otherwise. For the tests which test central hosting,
create a file called central-info.xml in the same directory as this README
file, with the following content:

	<data>
		<hostname>localhost</hostname>
		<username>username</username>
		<password>password</password>
	</data>

This provides the required information for the database to connect to.

To add a new test, create a corresponding python script file, and add it to
the list in test.xml.
