2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/box_db.[h|cc]: Move the database stuff into the Base_DB class to
	make the code a bit clearer. Connect to the signal of the document in 
	a set_document() override instead of the on_load_document() override.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* po/il.po: Italian translation from Alberto Paro.
	* various headers: Alberto Paro added includes for libintl.h because 
	he says gettext() is not defined without them. It is strange that it 
	works for me, but they do no harm. I need to look at this properly.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* po/de.po: German translation from Hendrik Brandt.

2004-06-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Mode menu: removed the Design Mode.
	* Developer menu: Added Fields, Relatationships, Users, and Layout, to 
	show the same functionality in secondary windows.

2004-06-09  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "sv" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.[h|cc], glom/Document/Document_Glom.[h|cc], and 
	others: The AppState (User Level) is now dependent on the document so 
	different instances (each with 1 document) can have different 
	user levels. And the user level is Operator if the file is read-only.
	* glom/Navigation/Box_DB_Tables.cc: Enable/Disable the extra UI in 
	fill_from_database() instead of the constructor, so that they are 
	changed when the user level changes. The table title is not yet shown 
	instead of the table name when in operator mode.

2004-06-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Changed all source code filenames to lowercase, because it was 
	getting ugly, and imported into GNOME cvs.

0.8.0:

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.cc: init_menus(): Give Mode/Find a control-F 
	shortcut. Find does not work yet.
	* glom/Mode_Design/Box_Table_FieldDefinitions: Show the field titles 
	in the list of fields.
	* Changed all std::strings to Glib::ustrings. Thanks regexxer.
	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.cc set_data_layout_groups(): Really save 
	the groups.

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Data_Structure/Field.cc: sql(): Put quotes around dates and 
	time, so that entering them works in Date mode.

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.cc: set_tables(): Removed old code that 
	caused tables to always be marked as hidden.
	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: Change Related Records frame to
	HIG-style.

2004-06-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data.cc: get_fields_to_show(): Remove any fields 
	that are no longer in the database. This method is horribly 
	inefficient.
	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: fill_related(): Do not try to 
	show records from a relationship that uses a field that does not exist 
	any longer in the other table.
	* Detail and List use Filed::value_to_string(), which deals with NULLs
	instead of filling them with the text NULL.

2004-06-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Frame_Glom.cc: on_userlevel_changed(): Really switch to data 
	mode if the current mode is not allowed for the new userlevel.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/: Added EntryGlom, which is an Entry with an
	edited signal that is only emitted when the user finishes editing.
	* glom/Utility_Widgets/flowtable_withfields.[h|cc]: Use EntryGlom 
	instead of Gtk::Entry.
	* glom/application.cc: init_menus(): Put the standard bakery save and
	saveas actions in the list of developer-mode actions, so that they
	will be disabled when in operator mode. Actually, I need to remove
	save anyway, because it should save automatically.
	* Added standard GPL copyright headers to all files.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Data Details changing of data now works, though it is doing an 
	insane amount of UPDATE commands.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Data Layouts now show newly-added fields.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: Reordering the fields in the 
	Data Layout really works now.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Show the table title in the Data Layout dialog, and on the main
	window.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/flow_table.cc: on_allocate(): Fixed awful 
	calculation bug, so the Data Details view now shows itself properly.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.h: Changed get/set_hidden_tables() to 
	get/set_tables(), using the new TableInfo class, so that we can 
	save table titles.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* application.cc: init(): If it is a default empty document, offer 
	a choice of opening an existing document, or starting a new document, 
	to make it clearer that you need a document to work with the database.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Navigation: The user can not open a table that the document does not
	know about. We really need up-to-date information in the document, so 
	in future we must automatically-save it.
	* List entry: Works again. Instead of using the postgres 
	serial/auto-increment field type, I have added a hack that does a 
	max() to get the next value. Maybe we can fix libgda to make it 
	work with serial.

2004-06-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_DB_Data::get_fields_for_table() now gets some information from 
	the document - the information that libgda does not tell us.

2004-06-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* All field information is now saved in the document when a table is 
	opened, and auto_increment information from the database is ignored,
	because libgda does not give us that information.

2004-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_List::Fill(): Fixed some awful bugs - the
	list view now shows all the fields and stores changes properly.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.[h|cc]: get/set_data_layout*(): Removed 
	the hidden_fields argument - now the LayoutItems have a m_hidden 
	member instead.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Design/Box_DB_Table_Definition.cc:postgres_change_column():
	Use to_date(), to_number(), and to_timestamp(), when CAST does not 
	work. So now all field type conversions work.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layout groups can not have duplicate names.

2004-05-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layout groups are now saved too.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layouts are now saved.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* The beginnings of the Data Layout dialog.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added Notebook_Glom::merge_special_menus() so that modes can have 
	their own extra menus.
	* Added Box_Data::show_layout_dialog().

2004-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* FlowTable: Fixed several position problems.

2004-05-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Combo_FieldType: made get give what you set.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* The Field Definition dialog is now done via libglademm.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Design/Fields/Combo_Type: Now derives from ComboBox instead
	of Combo.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added Data_Structure/FieldType, which defines some simple Glom-only
	types, and what underlying types to use for these. From now on, Glom
	can not be used on databases that do not use these simple types. It
	will refuse to edit fields that use other types.

2004-05-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_Data_List: Gets specific fields (specified by document) instead 
	of all fields.

2004-05-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* FlowTable now has 2 widgets in each row of each column. Kind of 
	works.

2004-05-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AppState: Added userlevel_changed signal.

2004-05-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Changing the field type works sometimes.

2004-05-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added FlowTableWithFields, and used it a bit.

2004-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets:/ Addded FlowTable container.

2004-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* App_Glom and Frame_Glom are now instantiated from glom.glade, 
	with get_widget_derived().

2004-04-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Information about which tables are hidden is now saved in the 
	document.

2004-04-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Replaced Connection with ConnectionPool which does more appropriate
	sharing of the connection.

2004-04-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AddDel: Used an AddDelColumnInfo field to simplify it a bit.

2004-04-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_Databases now loads its UI from a libglade file.

2004-04-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added FieldTypes class and used it to get the actual GdaValueTypes
	and therefore show the correct field type in the Table Definition.
	* Added User Level menu.

2004-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AddDel: Used derived TreeViewColumn so we can store extra column
	information, so we can deal with reordered view columns.

2004-04-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Creating tables works, though defining them does not. Creating 
	databases does not work.

2004-04-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Initial port from mysqlcppapi to libgdamm. It doesn't do much but 
	you can navigate to a table with postgressql.

2004-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Updated for gtkmm 2.4 API.

0.7.0:

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glom/Dialog_Glom.[h|cc]: Inherit from Gtk::Dialog instead of 
	Gtk::Window and use the action_area.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Users can now see full Details of Related Records by choosing Edit.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/AddDel/AddDel.cc: Respected m_bHasRowTitles in
	get_value() and set_value(). This means that the Related Records pane
	in Data/Details now works again.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for latest mysqlcppapi API - using shared, reference-counted
	objects.

0.6.0:
	
2003-01-20  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Did some funky TreeView on_button_press_event() stuff to fix the
	context-menu and Design/Relationships popups. 

2003-01-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Now uses true bool model column types. This was achieved with some
	unpleasantly lengthy new/delete and switch/case stuff.

2003-01-14  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Data_Details works.
	* Adding new records works.
	* Used more stock buttons.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Opening of database when opening old documents works again - the 
	Bakery API had changed so on_Document_load() needed to be changed to
	on_document_load() so that it was an override.
	* Data_Details kind of works.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* popup columns now work.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Column titles are now set properly.
	* Field definition editing works via the Edit dialog.
	* Added CellRendererList, from the gtkmm examples - doesn't quite
	work yet.

2003-01-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for Bakery 1.3.7, with no gnomemm dependency.

2002-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Used intltool, like the gnomemm_hello
	build files. The intl, macros, and scripts directories are no longer
	used.
	* Updated for latest libxml++ API.
	* Added std:: prefixes where necessary.

2002-11-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used Bakery::Document_XML now that it is part of Bakery itself, and
	use libxml++ API instead of Xerces-C++ because that is what it uses.
	This means that there are no more --with- options needed by the
	configure script.

2002-09-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Disabled part of Notebook_Find to prevent warnings and segfault
	on exit. It didn't do anything yet anyway.

2002-09-19  Murray Cummign  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Dialog_FieldDefinition: Show()ed the child notebook, so field
	definition editing works again.

2002-09-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Notebook_Glom: The signal handlers were hiding the base class
	implementations.
	* Frame_Glom::show_ok_dialog(): Now use Gtk::MessageDialog.

2002-09-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* AddDel widget: Adding of items now works, so Glom can create new
	databases and tables again.

2002-08-07  Murray Cummign  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for latest Menu::popup() API.

2002-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@localhost.localdomain>

	* Updated for latest pack_start enum and use new TreeView editable
	cells method.

2002-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for changed gtkmm2 pack_start() and TreeView APIs.

2002-03-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net

	* Used pkg-config checks instead of the various old .m4 macros,
	and changed Xerces C++ version to 1.7.
	* Replaced gtk-- 1.2 includes with gtkmm2 includes.
	* Prefixed Xerces C++ includes with xercesc, as required by 1.7.
	* Changed e.g. clicked.connect(SigC::slot(this to
	signal_clicked.connect(SigC::slot(*this.
	* Replaced use of Gnome::Dialog with Gtk::MessageDialog.
	* Replaced use of Gnome::PropertyBox with a similar, but custom Window
	class.
	* Changed Gtk::wrap() to Glib::wrap(), and gtkobj() to gobj().
   * Changed Gtk::Widget::set_usize() to set_default_size().
