2004-10-29  Mike Castle  <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com>

	* Added lots of libintl.h includes to fix build on some platforms.

2004-10-18  Baris Cicek <baris@teamforce.name.tr>

	* configure.in:  Added tr to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-08-20  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added es to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-08-11  Ankit Patel <ankit@redhat.com>

	* configure.in : Added "gu" to ALL_LINGUAS.

0.8.8:
	
2004-08-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/: Added layouts sub-directory, and moved layout 
	classes into it. Created a polymorphic heirarchy of layout items - 
	currently LayoutItem_Field and LayoutGroup for fields and groups of 
	fields.
	* glom/data_structure/layoutgroup.[h|cc]: Removed m_others. Designers 
	must put fields in a top-level group with no title, and that's the 
	default.
        * glom/document/document_glom.[h}cc]: Allow nested layout groups.
	* glom/mode_data/dialog_layout_details.[h|cc]: Use only one TreeView 
	instead of 2, using a TreeStore instead of a ListStore, to show fields 
	inside groups, and with nested groups. Allow the user to specify the 
	number of columns for the groups.
	* glom/mode_data/: Added treestore_layout.[h|cc], so that we can 
	override the vfunc to control whether items can be dragged into other 
	items.

2004-07-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtablewithfields.cc: add_field(): 
	Right-align the labels. TODO: Does not actually work.

2004-07-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* docs/user-guide/C/glom.xml: Explain how to use glom as an Operator 
	and as a Developer.

2004-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/field.cc: sql(): Create sql text representation 
	depending on the expected value type rather than the actual value 
	type, to prevent SQL errors when using relationships between fields of 
	different types.

2004-07-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_design/tables_relationships.[h|cc]: Actually delete 
	relationships when the Delete button is pressed.

0.8.7:

2004-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in: Depend on bakery 2.3.8, because that has a fix to 
	prevent the crash when changing user levels on the details view when 
	there are related records.

2004-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc: get_item_max_width(): Don't 
	ignore the vertical padding between widgets, so that this does not 
	incorrectly report that more items could be in the column.
	on_size_allocate(): Use = instead of += when using the single_items 
	width to get the maximum width, to prevent a big gap between the 
	first and second columns.

2004-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/document_glom.cc: save_before(): Store the layout item 
	sequence, so that the layout is not lost after a couple of saves.

2004-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/document_glom.cc: load_after(): Load the field 
	calculation from the field node rather than the lookup node, because 
	that is where we saved it.

2004-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/main.cc, application.[h|cc]: Make the application quit if the 
	user presses cancel on the new-or-existing dialog.

2004-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/glom_python.cc: Make 
	glom_evaluate_python_function_implementation() return a Value instead 
	of a string, and take a field type parameter.
	* glom/box_db_table.cc: Remove record_new().
	* glom/mode_data/box_data.cc: Rename record_new_from_entered() to 
	record_new() with an optional use_entered bool parameter, and use this 
	everywhere instead of record_new_from_entered. This means that the 
	first value entered in a new record in the list view will not be 
	forgotten. Also, this now sets the default value from calculations 
	where that is specified.

2004-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/: Added datawidget.[h|cc]: This widget can hold 
	either an EntryGlom or a checkbox, depending on the field type. Used 
	this in the Field Definition dialog and the FlowTableWithFields for the
	Details view.

2004-07-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/glomconversions: parse_value(): Return success 
	when parsing empty date, time, and numbers as nulls.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc: 
	on_combo_lookup_relationship_changed(): Clear the list of fields 
	before adding more.
	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtablewithfields.cc: Add a checkbox instead 
	of an entryglom if it is a boolean field.

2004-07-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc: fill_from_database(): make the window 
	bigger when in developer mode, because there is more to see.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.[h|cc]: Use an 
	EntryGlom instead of an Entry for the default value, so that it gets 
	validated and internationalized and so that the value does not get 
	interpreted as a string. This should deal with NULL properly.
	* glom/utilty_widgets/entryglom.[h|cc]: Add methods to get and set 
	values so that code does not need to get the specific widget.
	* glom/data_structure/field.[h|cc]: Have both canonical and 
	translated field type names, and make this clearer in the API. This 
	allows us to use the english names in the XML document, but show the 
	translated names in the user-interface.

2004-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Embed python for calculated fields:
	* scripts/macros.m4: GLOM_ARG_ENABLE_WARNINGS: Add -Wno-long-long so 
	that the C++ compiler does not complain about the long longs in the 
	python headers.
	* Added acinclude.m4, copied from pygtk, with additions from the 
	version in Plannet. Used the AM_CHECK_PYTHON_INCLUDES macro in 
	configure.in to detect the python headers and libs.
	* glom/glade.glom: Added widgets for field calculation to the 
	Field Definition dialog.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.[h|cc]: Load and save 
	the field calculation.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/: Added dialog_fieldcalculation.[h|cc] that 
	can be opened from the Field Definition window to edit and test the 
	python code.
	* glom/: Added glom_python.[h|cc]: With a function that can evaluate 
	arbitrary python code as if it is a python function definition.
	* glom/main.cc: Intialize and terminate the python runtime.

0.8.6:

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/main.cc: Accept a URI on the command line, and use it
	to open an existing document if any.
	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Add URI parameter to init(), and use it.
	* glom/data_structure/layoutgroup.[h|cc]: Add boolean m_others 
	member variable and use it instead of checking the group name.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_databases.cc: Use the UNIX user name by default, 
	because it is often the same as the postgres user name.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Add intermediate signal handlers for the 
	User Level menu items because use of sigc::bind with RefPtrs might be 
	causing crashes.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc: fill_from_database(): Correct typo so 
	that the hidden status is shown correctly.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/glade.glom: In Table Navigation, change Cancel button to a close
	button, because this window is opened to edit as well as to navigate.
	* glom/navigatin/box_tables.cc: Make sure that changes are saved to 
	the document immediately, because we no longer automatically ask 
	all views to save into the document before writing to disk.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/Document_Glom.cc: set_modified(): Call save_before() 
	and write_to_disk() instead of save() because that gets all the data 
	from the views again.

2004-07-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/Document_Glom.cc: set_modified(): Do nothing if the 
	modified status is already what it would be set to, to prevent 
	infinite loops.
	* glom/application.cc offer_new_or_existing(): Keep offering if the 
	user cancels at some stage.

2004-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/Document_Glom.cc: When in developer mode, save all 
	changes immediately and automatically. Lets see how much disk activity 
	this creates.

2004-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/applciation,cc init_layout(): Do not create the toolbar, 
	because it is not useful for this application.

2004-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_db_tables.cc: save_to_document(): Only save 
	something when something has been modified.

2004-07-04  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

	* configure.in: Added "fr" (French) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/Document_Glom.[h|cc]: Cache all the data in 
	member variables and only deal with the XML DOM when loading and 
	saving, in overrides of load_before() and save_after(). This makes the 
	code nicer and faster.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Renamed all the ugly on_AddDel_* methods to slightly less ugly 
	on_adddel_* methods.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added glom.keys and glom.mime, and added rules in Makefile.am to 
	install them. This is for the old MIME-type registration system, 
	because GNOME 2.6 seems to need both the old and new systems.

0.8.5:

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel_withbuttons.cc: Use a stock 
	Open button instead of one that says Edit. It's nicer.
	* glom/mode_find/box_data_list_find.cc: Make the Find button position 
	sensible.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_find/box_data_list_find.cc fill_from_database(): Save the
	fields into m_Fields, so that get_WhereClause() knows about them. Find 
	in the List view now works.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtablewithfields: Handle field_edited 
	signal of sub-flowtables so that glom responds to editing of a field 
	in a group on the Details view.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_data/box_data.[h|cc] and derived classes: Change 
	get_Entered_Field to get_entered_field_data() which takes a Field and 
	returns a Gnome::Gda::Value. This makes Find mode work for the Details 
	view at least.

2004-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_find/: Make the find mode show some widgets, by 
	re-activating some old code and adding the boxes and notebooks to the 
	Bakery composite View so that they know about the document.

2004-07-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_db_tables.cc: on_AddDel_changed(): Update the 
	document properly when a table is renamed, so that glom does not 
	complain that it knows nothing about the table. Also, update the 
	AddDel with the new table name as they key, so that it does not try 
	to operate on the old table name.

0.8.4:

2004-06-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc on_size_allocate(): Correct x 
	posititioning of 2nd column when using single items.
	get_field(): Put the recursive stuff in the field(sting id) overload, 
	because that's the one that gets called by the field(field) overload.

2004-06-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtablewithfields.cc: Added add_group() and 
	used it in mode_data/box_table_data.cc fill_layout(). Layout groups 
	are now shown inside a HIG-style frame.
	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc on_AddDel_add(), and
	  glom/mode_design/fields/box_db_tabledefnition.cc on_AddDel_add(): 
	Create a default title for tables and fields.

2004-06-29  Gareth Owen  <gowen72@yahoo.com>

	* configure.in: Added en_GB to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-06-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable.cc: get_minimum_column_height(), 
	get_column_height(): Make single items take up the whole width, 
	instead of affecting the width of the first sub-column.

2004-06-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/box_db.[h|cc]: Add get_default_button() virtual method, and 
	add implementation in glom/navigation/box_databases.cc, and used it in 
	constructor Dialog_Glom, so that the connect button is the default 
	button, so you can just press return in the password box to connect.

2004-06-25  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in: Removed AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIRS(), which was causing 
	problems.

2004-06-24  Duarte Loreto <happyguy_pt@hotmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added Portuguese (pt) to ALL_LINGUAS.

0.8.2:
	
2004-06-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.[h|cc]: Added on override of on_menu_help_init() to 
	merge in a menu item for the user guide. Called gnome_help_display() in
	the menu signal handler to show the docs.
	* glom/main.cc: Call gnome_program_init() so that gnome_help_display() 
	has the information that it needs. Hopefully this coexists with our
	Gtk::Main initialisation.
	* configure.in: Depend on libgnome, because that is where 
	gnome_help_display is. That is not good but at least it is not 
	libgnomeui.
	* Makefile.am: Add some defines needed by gnome_program_init() - see 
	comments in Makefile.am.

2004-06-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* configure.in, docs/user-guide: Added skeleton for the user guide. 

2004-06-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_design/fields/box_db_table_definition.cc: 
	get_field_definition(): Prevent crash - do not try to use a 
	TreeModel::iterator as the index to a vector.

2004-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added glom.applications, to register glom as capable of opening 
	glom files.
	* Makefile.am: Install glom.applications in the applications-registry.
	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc: fill_from_database(): Show tables 
	that are in the database, but not in the document, as hidden, if in 
	developer mode.
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.cc : set_column_choices(): Get the
	cellrenderer for the view column, not the model column. Among other 
	things, this makes the Relationships dialog work again.
	* glom/mode_design/dialog_relationships.[h|cc]: Add an on_hide() 
	override to actually save the relationships when the dialog is closed.
	
0.8.2:

2004-06-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc fill_from_database(): Make 
	auto-increment fields non-editable.

2004-06-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel.cc add_column(Field): Make the column 
	non-editable if it is an auto-increment field, because the user should 
	never change or create those values.
	* glom/glom.glade: Create a HIG information dialog. Use it in 
	glom/frame_glom.cc show_ok_dialog().
	* glom/mode_design/box_db_tabledefinition.cc: on_AddDel_del(): Correct 
	for loop, so that we actually delete the field.
	* glom/base_db: get_fields_for_table(): Ignore any fields that are no 
	longer in the database. Among other things, this makes the field 
	definition window update correctly after deleting a field.
	* glom/frame_glom.cc: Update the data view when the fields window 
	is closed, because the structure might have changed.
	* glom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc: parse_value(): When parsing 
	a string as a number, create a GdaNumeric-based GdaValue instead of a 
	float, because that is the numeric type that we are using eveywhere. 
	Actually, maybe it's not the best type.
	* All over the place: Fixed lots of primary_key arguments to be 
	Gnome::Gda::Values rather than strings, and therefore made sure that 
	Field::sql() was used with them.

2004-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/document/document_glom.[h|cc]: Added get_default_table().
	* glom/frame_glom.cc: on_Box_Databases_selected(): open the default 
	table instead of showing the list of tables, if there is a default 
	table.

2004-06-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/glade.glom, glom/mode_design/fields/dialog_fielddefinition.cc: 
	Moved Default Value into its own Notebook tab, with new Lookup widgets.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.cc: Make the rows have alternating 
	colors when the theme does that. Among other things, this makes the 
	data list look different to the field list.
	* The lookup details are not actually used yet to do any lookups.

2004-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.[h|cc]: Simplifified the code for 
	the placeholder row a bit.
	* glom/navigation/box_db_tables.cc, 
	glom/mode_design/fields/box_table_field_definitions.cc: Fixed some odd 
	focus errors (hopefully) caused by rebuilding the TreeModel in a 
	CellRenderer signal handler.
	* glom/mode_design/fields/box_table_field_definitions.cc:
	get_field_definition(): Store the field title in the result, not in 
	the temporary field instance, so that new titles are really saved.

2004-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc: on_AddDel_changed(): Implement 
	renaming of tables.

2004-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.cc: Corrected problems with the 
	AddDel changes: Adding a record works again, and editing a list record 
	shows the correct record in the Details view.

2004-06-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel.[h|cc]: add_item(), remove_item(), 
	get_row() now use a key value instead of the value in the first column.
	This is a hidden TreeModel column. There is also a bool placeholder 
	column, used to mark the blank row that is for the user to add a new 
	row. This scheme should make it easier to handle reorderered rows, and 
	it allows us to get a unique identifier for a changed row even when 
	responding to a change an it is the first row (such as a field name) 
	that has changed.

2004-06-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel.[h|cc]: The API now uses Gtk::TreeModel
	iterators instead of integer indexes. The previous API was an 
	abstraction layer that is no longer required now that we have 
	Gtk::TreeView and plan to keep using it.
	* other files: Adapted accordingly.

0.8.1:

2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.cc: show_hint(): Do not show the help hints at the 
	bottom - they are just annoying and not really necessary anymore.
	
2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc: Simplify the time_get and 
	time_put code by using the default template iterators.
	
2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/glomconversions.cc: Various corrections from 
	Daniel Elstner (king of C++). Also fallback to parsing time in the C 
	locale, because parsing in the current locale never seems to work.
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.cc: on_treeview_celledited(),
	  glom/utility)widgets/entryglom: check_changed(): Update the entry 
	with the text as it would be displayed in the locale, after editing, 
	so that the user gets immediate feedback.

2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/dialog_data_invalid.[h|cc}, glom.glade: New dialog to show 
	when the user enters incorrect data, with advice, and offer to revert.
	glom/utility_widgets/entryglom.cc: check_for_changes(): Show the new 
	dialog, and put the focus back in the entry if the user tries again.
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.cc: on_treeview_cell_edited(): 
	Do the same, though the cell is obviously not reactivated properly.
	
2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/entryglom.cc: check_for_change(): Complain 
	about unparseable data (such as dates and times) instead of sending 
	garbage to the database. This dialog should be improved (see comments) 
	and we need the same thing for the List view.
	
2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Moved generic parse/format routines to 
	glom/data_structure/glomconversions.[h|cc] from 
	glom/utility_widgets/entryglom.[h|cc].
	* glom/utility_widgets/adddel/adddel.[h|cc]: Add add_column() override 
	that takes a Field. Add set_value(Gda::Value) and get_value_as_value() 
	methods that use the glomconversions.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_list.cc: fill_from_database(), 
	on_adddel_changed(): Use the GdaValue-based AddDel API so that dates, 
	times, and numbers are shown and parsed as per the locale.
	
2004-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable_withfields.cc: Change all parsing to 
	use C++ streams and facets, and rearranged them into generic 
	conversion routines that can be used elsewhere and should be moved 
	elsewhere too. Added conversions to ISO formats, fo use in SQL 
	statments.
	* glom/data_structure/field.cc: sql(): Use these conversion routines 
	to get text representations for SQL.

2004-06-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable_withfields.cc: get_suitable_width(): 
	Use static locale-specific conversion function from EntryGlom to get 
	example text so that the number, date, and time fields have suitable 
	widths in all locales.

2004-06-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* po/: Update it.po from Albert Paro.
	* configure.in: Re-enabled it.po now that the invalid multibyte 
	sequences are fixed.

2004-06-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@.com>

	* Do locale-specific display and parsing of dates, times, and numbers 
	in the Data Details.
	* glom/utility_widgets/entryglom.[h|cc]: Added Gda::Value-based 
	get_value() and set_value(), which show and parse the text based on 
	the field type and the locale, though there are still some TODOS in 
	the code.
	* glom/mode_data/box_data_details.cc: Use EntryGlom::set/get_value() 
	instead of set/get_text(), so we delegate parsing/representation to 
	the EntryGlom.

2004-06-10  Adam Weinberger  <adamw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added en_CA to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/entryglom.[h|cc]: Started to add validation, 
	depending on the field type.

2004-06-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/data_structure/: Removed fieldtype.[h|cc] to simplify things, 
	moving some of the static functions into the Field class.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/utility_widgets/flowtable_withstyles.[h|cc]: Use PangoLayout to 
	calculate an appropriate width for fields of different types. Need to 
	do locale-specific stuff here though.

2004-06-10  Gustavo Noronha Silva  <kov@debian.org>

	* configure.in: added pt_BR to ALL_LINGUAS

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added macros/macros.m4, and used the macro in configure.in, to add 
	--enable-warnings configure options, and used them by default in 
	autogen.sh. So now it builds with warnings by default.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/navigation/box_tables.cc: Handle AddDel::signal_user_changed so
	that changes are saved immediately. It does not update the list of 
	non-hidden tables properly yet though. The AddDel columns are no 
	longer editable when in operator mode.
	* glom/frame_glom.[h|cc]: Do not allow the user to design fields, 
	relationships, or layouts if no table has been selected.
	* glom/application.cc, frame_glom.[h|cc]: on_menu_userlevel_*(): 
	Use sigc::bind to send the RadioAction to the signal handler, so we 
	can check if it is active, because the signal seems to be sent both 
	when the menu item is un-activated (as a result of another radioaction 
	being activated) and when it is activated.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/box_db.[h|cc]: Move the database stuff into the Base_DB class to
	make the code a bit clearer. Connect to the signal of the document in 
	a set_document() override instead of the on_load_document() override.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* po/il.po: Italian translation from Alberto Paro.
	* various headers: Alberto Paro added includes for libintl.h because 
	he says gettext() is not defined without them. It is strange that it 
	works for me, but they do no harm. I need to look at this properly.

2004-06-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* po/de.po: German translation from Hendrik Brandt.

2004-06-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Mode menu: removed the Design Mode.
	* Developer menu: Added Fields, Relatationships, Users, and Layout, to 
	show the same functionality in secondary windows.

2004-06-09  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "sv" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-06-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.[h|cc], glom/Document/Document_Glom.[h|cc], and 
	others: The AppState (User Level) is now dependent on the document so 
	different instances (each with 1 document) can have different 
	user levels. And the user level is Operator if the file is read-only.
	* glom/Navigation/Box_DB_Tables.cc: Enable/Disable the extra UI in 
	fill_from_database() instead of the constructor, so that they are 
	changed when the user level changes. The table title is not yet shown 
	instead of the table name when in operator mode.

2004-06-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Changed all source code filenames to lowercase, because it was 
	getting ugly, and imported into GNOME cvs.

0.8.0:

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/application.cc: init_menus(): Give Mode/Find a control-F 
	shortcut. Find does not work yet.
	* glom/Mode_Design/Box_Table_FieldDefinitions: Show the field titles 
	in the list of fields.
	* Changed all std::strings to Glib::ustrings. Thanks regexxer.
	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.cc set_data_layout_groups(): Really save 
	the groups.

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Data_Structure/Field.cc: sql(): Put quotes around dates and 
	time, so that entering them works in Date mode.

2004-06-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.cc: set_tables(): Removed old code that 
	caused tables to always be marked as hidden.
	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: Change Related Records frame to
	HIG-style.

2004-06-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data.cc: get_fields_to_show(): Remove any fields 
	that are no longer in the database. This method is horribly 
	inefficient.
	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: fill_related(): Do not try to 
	show records from a relationship that uses a field that does not exist 
	any longer in the other table.
	* Detail and List use Filed::value_to_string(), which deals with NULLs
	instead of filling them with the text NULL.

2004-06-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Frame_Glom.cc: on_userlevel_changed(): Really switch to data 
	mode if the current mode is not allowed for the new userlevel.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/: Added EntryGlom, which is an Entry with an
	edited signal that is only emitted when the user finishes editing.
	* glom/Utility_Widgets/flowtable_withfields.[h|cc]: Use EntryGlom 
	instead of Gtk::Entry.
	* glom/application.cc: init_menus(): Put the standard bakery save and
	saveas actions in the list of developer-mode actions, so that they
	will be disabled when in operator mode. Actually, I need to remove
	save anyway, because it should save automatically.
	* Added standard GPL copyright headers to all files.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Data Details changing of data now works, though it is doing an 
	insane amount of UPDATE commands.

2004-06-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Data Layouts now show newly-added fields.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_Details.cc: Reordering the fields in the 
	Data Layout really works now.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Show the table title in the Data Layout dialog, and on the main
	window.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/flow_table.cc: on_allocate(): Fixed awful 
	calculation bug, so the Data Details view now shows itself properly.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.h: Changed get/set_hidden_tables() to 
	get/set_tables(), using the new TableInfo class, so that we can 
	save table titles.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* application.cc: init(): If it is a default empty document, offer 
	a choice of opening an existing document, or starting a new document, 
	to make it clearer that you need a document to work with the database.

2004-06-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Navigation: The user can not open a table that the document does not
	know about. We really need up-to-date information in the document, so 
	in future we must automatically-save it.
	* List entry: Works again. Instead of using the postgres 
	serial/auto-increment field type, I have added a hack that does a 
	max() to get the next value. Maybe we can fix libgda to make it 
	work with serial.

2004-06-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_DB_Data::get_fields_for_table() now gets some information from 
	the document - the information that libgda does not tell us.

2004-06-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* All field information is now saved in the document when a table is 
	opened, and auto_increment information from the database is ignored,
	because libgda does not give us that information.

2004-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@.com>

	* glom/Mode_Data/Box_Data_List::Fill(): Fixed some awful bugs - the
	list view now shows all the fields and stores changes properly.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Document/Document_Glom.[h|cc]: get/set_data_layout*(): Removed 
	the hidden_fields argument - now the LayoutItems have a m_hidden 
	member instead.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Design/Box_DB_Table_Definition.cc:postgres_change_column():
	Use to_date(), to_number(), and to_timestamp(), when CAST does not 
	work. So now all field type conversions work.

2004-05-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layout groups can not have duplicate names.

2004-05-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layout groups are now saved too.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Layouts are now saved.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* The beginnings of the Data Layout dialog.

2004-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added Notebook_Glom::merge_special_menus() so that modes can have 
	their own extra menus.
	* Added Box_Data::show_layout_dialog().

2004-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* FlowTable: Fixed several position problems.

2004-05-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Combo_FieldType: made get give what you set.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* The Field Definition dialog is now done via libglademm.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Mode_Design/Fields/Combo_Type: Now derives from ComboBox instead
	of Combo.

2004-05-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added Data_Structure/FieldType, which defines some simple Glom-only
	types, and what underlying types to use for these. From now on, Glom
	can not be used on databases that do not use these simple types. It
	will refuse to edit fields that use other types.

2004-05-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_Data_List: Gets specific fields (specified by document) instead 
	of all fields.

2004-05-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* FlowTable now has 2 widgets in each row of each column. Kind of 
	works.

2004-05-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AppState: Added userlevel_changed signal.

2004-05-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Changing the field type works sometimes.

2004-05-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added FlowTableWithFields, and used it a bit.

2004-05-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets:/ Addded FlowTable container.

2004-05-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* App_Glom and Frame_Glom are now instantiated from glom.glade, 
	with get_widget_derived().

2004-04-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Information about which tables are hidden is now saved in the 
	document.

2004-04-30  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Replaced Connection with ConnectionPool which does more appropriate
	sharing of the connection.

2004-04-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AddDel: Used an AddDelColumnInfo field to simplify it a bit.

2004-04-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Box_Databases now loads its UI from a libglade file.

2004-04-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Added FieldTypes class and used it to get the actual GdaValueTypes
	and therefore show the correct field type in the Table Definition.
	* Added User Level menu.

2004-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* AddDel: Used derived TreeViewColumn so we can store extra column
	information, so we can deal with reordered view columns.

2004-04-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Creating tables works, though defining them does not. Creating 
	databases does not work.

2004-04-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Initial port from mysqlcppapi to libgdamm. It doesn't do much but 
	you can navigate to a table with postgressql.

2004-04-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Updated for gtkmm 2.4 API.

0.7.0:

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glom/Dialog_Glom.[h|cc]: Inherit from Gtk::Dialog instead of 
	Gtk::Window and use the action_area.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Users can now see full Details of Related Records by choosing Edit.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* glom/Utility_Widgets/AddDel/AddDel.cc: Respected m_bHasRowTitles in
	get_value() and set_value(). This means that the Related Records pane
	in Data/Details now works again.

2003-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for latest mysqlcppapi API - using shared, reference-counted
	objects.

0.6.0:
	
2003-01-20  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Did some funky TreeView on_button_press_event() stuff to fix the
	context-menu and Design/Relationships popups. 

2003-01-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Now uses true bool model column types. This was achieved with some
	unpleasantly lengthy new/delete and switch/case stuff.

2003-01-14  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Data_Details works.
	* Adding new records works.
	* Used more stock buttons.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Opening of database when opening old documents works again - the 
	Bakery API had changed so on_Document_load() needed to be changed to
	on_document_load() so that it was an override.
	* Data_Details kind of works.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* popup columns now work.

2003-01-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Column titles are now set properly.
	* Field definition editing works via the Edit dialog.
	* Added CellRendererList, from the gtkmm examples - doesn't quite
	work yet.

2003-01-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for Bakery 1.3.7, with no gnomemm dependency.

2002-12-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Used intltool, like the gnomemm_hello
	build files. The intl, macros, and scripts directories are no longer
	used.
	* Updated for latest libxml++ API.
	* Added std:: prefixes where necessary.

2002-11-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Used Bakery::Document_XML now that it is part of Bakery itself, and
	use libxml++ API instead of Xerces-C++ because that is what it uses.
	This means that there are no more --with- options needed by the
	configure script.

2002-09-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Disabled part of Notebook_Find to prevent warnings and segfault
	on exit. It didn't do anything yet anyway.

2002-09-19  Murray Cummign  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Dialog_FieldDefinition: Show()ed the child notebook, so field
	definition editing works again.

2002-09-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Notebook_Glom: The signal handlers were hiding the base class
	implementations.
	* Frame_Glom::show_ok_dialog(): Now use Gtk::MessageDialog.

2002-09-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* AddDel widget: Adding of items now works, so Glom can create new
	databases and tables again.

2002-08-07  Murray Cummign  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for latest Menu::popup() API.

2002-07-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@localhost.localdomain>

	* Updated for latest pack_start enum and use new TreeView editable
	cells method.

2002-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated for changed gtkmm2 pack_start() and TreeView APIs.

2002-03-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net

	* Used pkg-config checks instead of the various old .m4 macros,
	and changed Xerces C++ version to 1.7.
	* Replaced gtk-- 1.2 includes with gtkmm2 includes.
	* Prefixed Xerces C++ includes with xercesc, as required by 1.7.
	* Changed e.g. clicked.connect(SigC::slot(this to
	signal_clicked.connect(SigC::slot(*this.
	* Replaced use of Gnome::Dialog with Gtk::MessageDialog.
	* Replaced use of Gnome::PropertyBox with a similar, but custom Window
	class.
	* Changed Gtk::wrap() to Glib::wrap(), and gtkobj() to gobj().
   * Changed Gtk::Widget::set_usize() to set_default_size().
