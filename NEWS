1.3.1 (unstable):

* Translations: Add Import and Export buttons, so you can use 
  the standard .po format. (Johannes Schmid)
* Connections: Don't bother trying alternative network ports 
  after one port was successful. Bug #368787 from Craig Keogh.
* Find: Prevent SQL Errors when using capital letters in table and field names.
  Bug #375605 from William Manley.
* Button scripts and calculated fields: Code now uses Python syntax-highlighting 
  colors, using GtkSourceView. (Johannes Schmid, Dodji Seketeli, Murray Cumming)
* Document:
  - Store scripts and other multi-line text in XML text nodes, instead 
  of attributes, to be more compatible with other (non-libxml) XML parsers, 
  such as Python's minidom.
  - Store the document format version in the document, warn when saving in 
  a new format, and fail to load when the format version is too new.
* Added --debug-sql commmand-line option, which prints out the generated 
  SQL commands. (Johannes Schmid, Murray Cumming)


1.2.0:

New features in Glom 1.2:

* Really remember the last-viewed record on the details view when navigating 
  between tables.
* List view: Remember column widths when you resize them manually.
  Bug #358089 from Peter Williams.
* Related records:

  invoice lines on an invoice record), even when only the ID key is shown.
* Help buttons now work, though more help text is needed.
  (Johannes Schmid and Don Scorgie)

    when setting a primary key.
  - Related records: Allow the developer to specify to what table the user 
    will be taken, or use the automatic choice.
  - List views and related records portals: 
    - Allow image fields in the lists.
    - When no fields are specified, show a hint about editing the layout.
    Bug #354073 from Peter Williams.
  - Python API (Calculated fields and button scripts):
    Added record.connection and record.table_name attributes, so you can 
    go wild with SQL with the whole pygda API, if you must.
    The connection is even open already, you lucky people. 
    See http://www.glom.org/wiki/index.php?title=Calculated_Fields_API#Using_the_full_pygda_API
    (Murray Cumming)
  - Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it 
    changed any data.
  - Field Formatting: You can now specify a number of text lines to show for 
    multi-line text. Bug #355907 from Peter Williams.
  - Layout editor dialogs: Added explanatory tooltips to the Add buttons.
  - Field calculation editor: Prevent translators from translating the 
    fragment of python code.

  - Avoid a SQL error when showing a doubly-related field without showing 
  the key field that is used in the relationship. 
  - Allow the developer to specify to what table the user will be taken 
  when clicking on the row button, or just use the automatic choice.
* Button scripts: Update the view after the script has run, in case it

  using all the rows of example data.

1.1.2:

* Related records:
  - When clicking the open button, show a warning dialog when the related

* Loading from examples: Handle quoted commas in the example data and reject badly 
  formatted example data.
* Build:
  - Added disable-update-mime-database configure option is apparently helpful 
  for distro packagers. Bug #351989. (Fryderyk Dziarmagowski)

* List View:
  - When clicking Add, put the cursor in the appropriate column. 
* Check for uniqueness before setting a value for a unique or primary-key field in the 
  database.
* Calculations:
  - Allow the calculations to detect empty non-text fields, via the None object.
  - Recalculate calculations when a relationship's from key is changed, if that 
  relationship is used in the calculation.
* In the Edit Tables dialog and Field Defintions dialog, do not double-click to open/edit, 
  because this leads to awkwardsness/surprise because single click edits the cells too.
* Layout: Slight performance and positioning improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Some more Windows/Cygwin build fixes. (Yselkowitz)  
* Slightly (very slightly) more tango-like application icon. (Murray Cumming)

1.0.3:

* Fields: Prevent crash when adding field in non-English locale.

  - Fix the [Find] button next to ID fields. It was wrongly saying that there 
  were no results.
  - Really offer a second find when no results are found.
  - Show the busy cursor while finding.
* Layout: Really save changes of related records portal layouts and of custom 
  field formatting. 
* Some Windows/Cygwin build fixes.

1.0.2:

* Added a "..." (better suggestions welcome) next to date fields, to 
  show a calendar dialog. New features like this should not be in the stable 
  series, but this could help to solve a strange locale bug that someone is 
  experiencing.

1.0.1:

* Correct failure while creating an example for the first time.
  (though it worked when you tried again.)
* Updated translations: 
  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)

0.9.91

* Creating databases: Make sure that the user is in the developer group, even if he has never 
  opened an example, allowing him to change his own database.
* Date fields:
 - Show and parse 4 digits for the year, even if the locale (stftime) stupidly thinks otherwise, 
   though this need attention from translators in affected locales. Fixed for en_GB (Britain).
   Was not a problem for en_US or de_DE.
* Details layouts:
 - Fields with choices are no longer insensitive when read-only, so you can now, 
   for instance, select and copy text out of them, or see what is in their menus.

0.9.9:

* Details layouts:
  - Added a Notebook layout part, with tabs, so the details can show more information, 
    such as several related layouts portals.
  - Stop pictures and calculated values from existing records appearing on new empty records.
* View Layouts and Reports:
  - Allow doubly-related fields. For instance, Actor::Agent::name on the Details of a 
    a Character record.
  - Add a Text layout part, for arbitrary text on the Details view, or reports.
* Reports:
  - Allow top-level fields in reports, for non-grouped-by reports.
  - Allow use of Group By parts without specified group-by fields, so they 
    can be (mis)used just to specify a sort field for non-grouped-by records.
  - Allow Group By parts to be sorted by multiple fields, and allow the sort 
    order (ascending or descending) to be specified.
  - Added Vertical Group report part, for packing more information into a row.
  - Allow adding of fields as siblings while selecting the field, instead of 
    requiring the user to select the parent group.
  - Allow custom formatting of fields.
  - Allow a border width to be specified for the records table cells.
  - Added a horizontal line below group-by titles.

0.9.8:

* Lookups: Fix intermittent problem that caused looked-up values to 
  not be stored in the database.
* Related Records: Correctly reload portal layouts that use related 
  (from the related table) fields, rather than just fields in the related table.
* Performance: Avoid querying for some unnecessary fields on Details view.

0.9.7:

* When creating from a read-only example, really do not mark the saved file 
  as not an example, and save the new database name, so you can open it 
  again from the saved file.
* Prevent duplicate table, field, relationship, and report names, 
  to prevent crashes.
* Field Definition:
  - Default Value tab renamed to Value.
  - Default Values and lookups are now grouped as 
    User Entry and are mutually exclusive with Calculation.
  - When changing a calculation, all values will be recalculated, 
    with a warning and the chance to cancel.
  - Fix crash when changing field type to number, when not all 
    existing values are valid numbers.
  - Fix crashes when converting from text to boolean.
  - Fix crashes when converting from boolean to number.
  - Preserve information when converting from anything to boolean.
* Details and List Views: Do not allow editing of calculated fields.

  - just go to the Details view.
* List layout: Warn that image fields are not supported on the 
  list view yet.
* Date and Time Parsing improvements.

  - Finnish (Ilkka Tuohela)
* Updated Translations:
  - Catalan (Josep Puigdemont)
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)

0.9.6:

* New built-in System Properties relationship:
  allows you to show fields from the system properties, such as 
  the organisation's name and address, on a layout or report.
* The Field Layout Properties dialog (right-click on a field in 
  developer mode to see the menu) now allows you to choose a custom title 
  for the field for this instance, in case the regular field title is not 
  appropriate. This is often the case for related fields.
* Save Field Layout Properties when the dialog closes. (Fixes a regression)
* Find:
  - Fix oddness in Details view when finding. (Fixes a regression)
  - Start Find mode on the current View, instead of always going to the Details view.

* Avoid python warnings when adding new records.
* Stop images from disappearing when refreshing layouts.

0.9.5:

* Details Layout:
  - Add Button layout item, to run arbitrary Python code, with access to 
    the record data.
  - Fix bugs that caused the layout changes to be forgotten (regressions).

  translated table titles, field titles, layout part titles, report titles, 
  etc, to be used when your Glom system is used in that locale.
* Prevent underscores from being interpreted as navigation markup in table 
  and report titles.
* Performance improvements.
* The .desktop file can now be translated.
* New Translations:
  - Vietnamese (Clytie Siddall)
* Updated Translations:
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)

* Image fields: Choosing clear from the context menu now really clears 
  the field in the database.
* Updated Translations:

0.9.1:

* List view: Show new records that were added in Details view.
  (Bug found by Daniel Holbach and Greg Breland.)
* List and Details views: Do not crash when entering ;, ', or " characters.

  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - German (Hendrik Brandt)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.9.0:

* Remembers last-viewed record and layout: If you view a record, then go 
  to another table, then come back, the same record will be shown, on the 
  same layout.
* Table title is now big and bold.
* Details view:
  -  ID fields that identify a unique related record (e.g. a Company ID on 
  a contacts record) now have a Find button, so you can search for the 
  related record, to get the ID.
  - When deleting a record, you will be asked for confirmation, as the 
  list view already does. And when deleting the only record, the record 
  will be blanked instead of still showing the dead record.

  well as the primary key.
* Details:
  - Related fields, with automatic related-record creation:
  Really write the new value into the related record, instead of 
  just creating the related record.
  - The default layout is now more useful.
  - Field titles are now visible again when there is only one 
  item in a multi-column group.

  averages, and counts.
  - Group By parts may now show extra "secondary" 
  fields, in addition to the field by which the records are 
  grouped. 
* Translations updated:
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)
  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - British English (Gareth Owen)

0.8.27:

* Simpler Tables menu replaces the Navigation/Tables 
  dialog window.
* Added simple reports functionality, via the Reports 
  menu.

0.8.26:

* For new databases, really allow the developer to create 
  and edit records. This has probably been broken since 
  the user administration was added.

  you can enter global values for the system name, 
  organisation details, and specify next values for 
  auto-incremented fields.
* Show the system name at the top of the window.

0.8.23:

* Details and List:
  - Allow a drop-down list of choices for a field.
    Either a custom list, such as Mr, Ms, Mrs, Miss, 
    or a list of related records, such as a list of 
    product codes. This is demonstrated in the 
    example, in the Invoices table.
- Details layout: Fields are now editable by default.
* Fixed various leaks and crashes, improved 
  performance, and simplified the code some more.

0.8.22:

* Field Definitions:
  - Do not save empty default values as "NULL" or 0.
  - Prevent crash when opening Field details a second 
    time.
  - Allow saving when the default value changes.
  - Calculated fields:
    - Simplified python API.
    - Aggregate calculations (sum, count, max, min) 
      on related records.

  the record's other field values. This requires 
  the python libgda bindings in gnome-python-extras 2.11.
* List: Do lookups, and refresh related fields, when 
  adding new records, not only when changing existing 
  records.
* Details and Lists Layout: Field formatting is now in a 
  separate dialog window.
* Boring Internals:
  - The List view's TreeModel now gets the data from the 
  database dynamically on-demand, though it probably 
  needs some more work to do that as efficiently as 
  possible.
  - Now depends on pygtk and gnome-python-extras/libgda.
* Translations:
  Updated: Candadian English (Adam Weinberger),
  German (Hendrik Brandt), Czech (Miloslav Trmac) 

0.8.20:

* Fix the boost::python build problem.
* Added highly experimental File/Print menu item. It 
  does stuff in the Details view. It should open some 
  HTML in your browser. glom installs an XSLT file 
  used to create the HTML, so feel free to improve it.
* Translations: Added Kinyarwanda translation. (Steve Murphy)

0.8.19:

* List and Details: When defining the layout, developers
  can specify numeric formatting, such as decimal places,
  and currency symbols.
* Details: Related Records now use all available layout 
  width, instead of having a fixed width.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Translations:
  - Pango markup and spaces not marked for translation.
    (Christian Rose)
  - Added Swedish (Christian Rose).
  - Updated Albanian (Laurent Dhima),
    Canadian English (Adam Weinberger),
    Czech (Miloslav Trmac),

  0.8.17. Sorry.

0.8.17:

* User/Groups Administration: 
  Choosing the Developer/Users menu now allows you to 
  create groups and specify view/edit/create/delete 
  access rights for each table for each group.
* Developer mode: Now only possible for users who are in 
  the developer group.
* Details view: You can now right-click on a field to add
  a field, group, or related records.
* Ignore pga_* tables created by pgadmin. 

0.8.16:

* Relationships:
  -  Allow the developer to specify whether related records 
  should be created automatically.
  - Do not clear the To Field column when the user clicks on it.
* Details/List views:
  - Automatic creation of related records:
  When you enter a value in a related field, when their is 
  not yet a key value to identify the related record, a 
  record can be create automatically, and the key value 
  will be filled in for you.
  - Developers may set fields on the layout as non-editable.


0.8.15:

* Related Fields:
  Details and List views can now show fields from related records.
  Just choose the relationship when you choose the field on 
  the layout. This even works in Related Records portals.
* Non-editable fields:
  When choosing a field for a layout, you can specify whether 
  editing of the field should be allowed.
* Dialogs are more HIG-compliant, using secondary text.
* Now requires gtkmm 2.6 instead of 2.4.

0.8.14:

* Details View: Adding records works even when a field appears
  more than once in the layout.
* List View: Deleting records works again.

0.8.13:

* Details:
  - Related Records now work, including automatic addition of new 
    related records.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on fields to choose a 
    different field.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on related records to 
    choose a different relationship and choose the fields to show.
  - Groups may now contain the same field more than once.
* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not 
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the 
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a 
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to 
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,
    allowing us to get data on-demand in future.
 
0.8.11:

* Postgres connection:
  - Connect to the template1 database when creating new databases, 
    because recent (?) versions of postgres require this.
  - Don't ignore the host name.
  - Added postgres_setup.txt and a non-libgda test to help 
    investigate connection problems.
  - Share connections more, without re-connecting, to increase speed.
* List Layout:
