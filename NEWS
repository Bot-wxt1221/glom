0.8.14:

* Details View: Adding records works even when a field appears
  more than once in the layout.
* List View: Deleting records works again.

0.8.13:

* Details:
  - Related Records now work, including automatic addition of new 
    related records.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on fields to choose a 
    different field.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on related records to 
    choose a different relationship and choose the fields to show.
  - Groups may now contain the same field more than once.
* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not 
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the 
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a 
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to 
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,
    allowing us to get data on-demand in future.
 
0.8.11:

* Postgres connection:
  - Connect to the template1 database when creating new databases, 
    because recent (?) versions of postgres require this.
  - Don't ignore the host name.
  - Added postgres_setup.txt and a non-libgda test to help 
    investigate connection problems.
  - Share connections more, without re-connecting, to increase speed.
* List Layout:
  - Fix bug that prevented data entry of fields that have 
    human-readable titles.
* Layout Design:
  - Fix loss of layout groups when loading.
  - Allow adding of related records (half-finished) in the 
    middle of the layout, and no longer show them automatically 
    in a notebook.
    (It's really time to make this feel like glade.)
* Navigation:
  - Show table titles instead of name when in Operator mode.
* Build:
  - Distribute the intltool files.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Cezar)
  - #include libintl.h in more files, required on some systems.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Mike Castle)
  - Fix Glib::wrap() build error with gcc 3.4.3.

0.8.10:

* Added an example document.
* Offer to create databases on the server based on documents,
  such as examples.
* Don't display empty dates, times, and numbers as "NULL".
* Specify empty dates and times to server in SQL as "NULL", not 
  as empty strings.
* Dialogs have default buttons. 
* Avoided a few crashes.

0.8.9:

* Really save details of new tables in the document.
* Create the tables inside the specified database, instead of 
  putting them all in the user's default postgress database.
* Enforce one database per document - ask for a new database name 
  when creating a new document instead of allowing the user 
  to choose an existing database.
* When there is still only one table, open it without asking the 
  user to choose a table, as if it is the default table.
* Show the database title in the window title bar, instead of 
  the filename.
(Murray Cumming)
* Fix an internationalization build problem. (Mike Castle)
* Added translations: 
  - Gujarati (Ankit Patel)
  - Punjabi (Amanpreet Singh Alam)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.8.8:

* Details Layout: Simpler, hierarchical layout. This allows 
  more complex layouts, and allows fields to appear more than 
  once on the same layout.
* Documentation: Added user manual, though it looks a 
  bit strange in yelp at the moment.
* Relationships:
  - Avoid crash when fields of differerent types are used in
  relationships.
  - Actually delete relationships when the delete button is pressed.

0.8.7:

* Field Definition:
  - Add Boolean field type, which is displayed as a checkbox.
  - Default values can be the result of python calculations.
  - Default values are validated according to the field type.
* Pressing cancel on the initial dialog closes the application.
* Details view:
  - Corrected widget layout problems.
  - Do not lose the layout groups after a while.
  - Fix crash when changing user level, with related records.
(Murray Cumming)

* Auto-save documents, when in developer mode, 
  instead of asking.

* MIME type registration: Use both old and new system, 
  as needed by GNOME 2.6.
* Allow a file to be specified on the command line.

  (Murray Cumming)
* Added French translation. (Christophe Merlet)

0.8.5:

* Data Details: Editing works again.
* Find mode now works, though it's simple.
* Edit buttons are now stock Open buttons.
* Renaming of tables: The new names are stored in the 
  document so you can rename again, and use the renamed table.
  (Murray Cumming)

* Connection dialog: The connect button is now activated when you press return in the password entry.
* Data Details: Groups of fields are now shown together in a HIG-style frame.
* Design: field, table, and layout group titles now have defaults, by replacing white space and 
  capitalizing.
* Some build improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added Portugese translation (Duarte Loreto)
* Added British English translation (Gareth Owen)

0.8.3:

* Design:

  - Relationships: Fix editing, and actually save the relationships.
* Beginnings of user documentation.
* Updated German translation (Hendrik Brandt)

0.8.2:

* Navigation / Tables : Fixed focus bug when adding tables.
* Fields can lookup their values from a field in 
  another table via a relationship.
* When a table is marked as the default then it will be 
  opened automatically when the database is opened.
* Tables can now be renamed.
* List and Data views: Auto-increment fields are non-editable.
* Update the Data view when field editing has finished.
* Code cleanup: AddDel widget is now iterator-based.
(Murray Cumming)

* Dutch translation. (Tino Meinen)
  

0.8.1:

* Details and List views: Dates, times, and numbers are now displayed 
  and parsed according to the current locale.
  (Murray Cumming, Daniel Elstner)
* Removed Design Mode - Added items to the Developer menu instead.
* Details view: The entry widgets for Date, time, and number fields now 
  have more suitable widths, so it looks nicer.
* User Level is now per-document (or per-instance) instead of per-application.
* The User Level is forced to Operator if the document is read-only.
* Do not show the help text because it's annoying.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added internationalization support, with the following translations:
  Italian (Alberto Paro)
  German (Hendrik Brandt)
  Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  Brazilian Portugese (Gustavo Noronha Silva)
  Swedish (Christian Rose)

* Now uses Postgres instead of MySQL, due to the MySQL license changes.
* Now uses libgda instead of mysqlcppapi.
* Now use libglademm to allow more improvement of the UI.
* Glom can no longer be used with database tables that it did not create.
* Now uses only a small set of simple field types.
* Added "User Level" - normal operators do not see design functionality.
  User Levels are bad, but this seems to be the only way to present the 
  design functionality next to the stuff being designed.
* Allows simple layout of List and Details views. (grouping in the Details view is not yet fully implemented)
* Saves all field information in the document.
* Tables can be hidden from normal users.


0.7.0:

* Updated for latest mysqlcppapi 2 API.
* Various document-saving fixes.

    - Human-readable field titles are now saved properly.
      (by requiring the latest libxml++)
