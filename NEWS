0.8.28:

* File/Print works for List view, printing a list of records 
  in the found set.
* Reports: Group By parts may now show extra "secondary" 
  fields, in addition to the field by which the records are 
  grouped. 
* Translations updated:
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)
  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  - British English (Gareth Owen)

0.8.27:

* Simpler Tables menu replaces the Navigation/Tables 
  dialog window.
* Added simple reports functionality, via the Reports 
  menu.

0.8.26:

* For new databases, really allow the developer to create 
  and edit records. This has probably been broken since 
  the user administration was added.
* Added Developer/Database Preferences menu item, where 
  you can enter global values for the system name, 
  organisation details, and specify next values for 
  auto-incremented fields.
* Show the system name at the top of the window.
* Find mode: Works again.
* Hide scrollbars when they are not needed.

0.8.25:

* Details: Use a bigger widget (TextView) with scrollbars 
  for multiline text fields.
* Details and List: Right-align numbers.
* Calculated fields: Do the calculations in the correct 
  order of their dependencies.
  
0.8.24:

* Remove debug code that hardcoded one file path, 
  so you can open any file.

0.8.23:

* Details and List:
  - Allow a drop-down list of choices for a field.
    Either a custom list, such as Mr, Ms, Mrs, Miss, 
    or a list of related records, such as a list of 
    product codes. This is demonstrated in the 
    example, in the Invoices table.
- Details layout: Fields are now editable by default.
* Fixed various leaks and crashes, improved 
  performance, and simplified the code some more.

0.8.22:

* Field Definitions:
  - Do not save empty default values as "NULL" or 0.
  - Prevent crash when opening Field details a second 
    time.
  - Allow saving when the default value changes.
  - Calculated fields:
    - Simplified python API.
    - Aggregate calculations (sum, count, max, min) 
      on related records.
    - Calculated fields may use the results of 
      other calculated fields.
    - Do not lose digits after decimal points.
    (Demonstrated in the Invoice table in the example.)
* List:
  - Really do lookups and recalculations when 
  adding new records.
* Details:
  - Related records: Only show related records, not 
    all records.
* g++ 3.4 build fixes.
* Translations:
  - Updated Spanish (Francisco Javier Fernandez)


0.8.21:

* Calculated Fields: Your python function can now use 
  the record's other field values. This requires 
  the python libgda bindings in gnome-python-extras 2.11.
* List: Do lookups, and refresh related fields, when 
  adding new records, not only when changing existing 
  records.
* Details and Lists Layout: Field formatting is now in a 
  separate dialog window.
* Boring Internals:
  - The List view's TreeModel now gets the data from the 
  database dynamically on-demand, though it probably 
  needs some more work to do that as efficiently as 
  possible.
  - Now depends on pygtk and gnome-python-extras/libgda.
* Translations:
  Updated: Candadian English (Adam Weinberger),
  German (Hendrik Brandt), Czech (Miloslav Trmac) 

0.8.20:

* Fix the boost::python build problem.
* Added highly experimental File/Print menu item. It 
  does stuff in the Details view. It should open some 
  HTML in your browser. glom installs an XSLT file 
  used to create the HTML, so feel free to improve it.
* Translations: Added Kinyarwanda translation. (Steve Murphy)

0.8.19:

* List and Details: When defining the layout, developers
  can specify numeric formatting, such as decimal places,
  and currency symbols.
* Details: Related Records now use all available layout 
  width, instead of having a fixed width.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Translations:
  - Pango markup and spaces not marked for translation.
    (Christian Rose)
  - Added Swedish (Christian Rose).
  - Updated Albanian (Laurent Dhima),
    Canadian English (Adam Weinberger),
    Czech (Miloslav Trmac),

0.8.18:

* The binary will be installed, fixing the problem in 
  0.8.17. Sorry.

0.8.17:

* User/Groups Administration: 
  Choosing the Developer/Users menu now allows you to 
  create groups and specify view/edit/create/delete 
  access rights for each table for each group.
* Developer mode: Now only possible for users who are in 
  the developer group.
* Details view: You can now right-click on a field to add
  a field, group, or related records.
* Ignore pga_* tables created by pgadmin. 

0.8.16:

* Relationships:
  -  Allow the developer to specify whether related records 
  should be created automatically.
  - Do not clear the To Field column when the user clicks on it.
* Details/List views:
  - Automatic creation of related records:
  When you enter a value in a related field, when their is 
  not yet a key value to identify the related record, a 
  record can be create automatically, and the key value 
  will be filled in for you.
  - Developers may set fields on the layout as non-editable.


0.8.15:

* Related Fields:
  Details and List views can now show fields from related records.
  Just choose the relationship when you choose the field on 
  the layout. This even works in Related Records portals.
* Non-editable fields:
  When choosing a field for a layout, you can specify whether 
  editing of the field should be allowed.
* Dialogs are more HIG-compliant, using secondary text.
* Now requires gtkmm 2.6 instead of 2.4.

0.8.14:

* Details View: Adding records works even when a field appears
  more than once in the layout.
* List View: Deleting records works again.

0.8.13:

* Details:
  - Related Records now work, including automatic addition of new 
    related records.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on fields to choose a 
    different field.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on related records to 
    choose a different relationship and choose the fields to show.
  - Groups may now contain the same field more than once.
* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not 
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the 
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a 
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to 
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,
    allowing us to get data on-demand in future.
 
0.8.11:

* Postgres connection:
  - Connect to the template1 database when creating new databases, 
    because recent (?) versions of postgres require this.
  - Don't ignore the host name.
  - Added postgres_setup.txt and a non-libgda test to help 
    investigate connection problems.
  - Share connections more, without re-connecting, to increase speed.
* List Layout:
  - Fix bug that prevented data entry of fields that have 
    human-readable titles.
* Layout Design:
  - Fix loss of layout groups when loading.
  - Allow adding of related records (half-finished) in the 
    middle of the layout, and no longer show them automatically 
    in a notebook.
    (It's really time to make this feel like glade.)
* Navigation:
  - Show table titles instead of name when in Operator mode.
* Build:
  - Distribute the intltool files.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Cezar)
  - #include libintl.h in more files, required on some systems.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Mike Castle)
  - Fix Glib::wrap() build error with gcc 3.4.3.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=160245 (Christian Krause)

0.8.10:

* Added an example document.
* Offer to create databases on the server based on documents,
  such as examples.
* Don't display empty dates, times, and numbers as "NULL".
* Specify empty dates and times to server in SQL as "NULL", not 
  as empty strings.
* Dialogs have default buttons. 
* Avoided a few crashes.

0.8.9:

* Really save details of new tables in the document.
* Create the tables inside the specified database, instead of 
  putting them all in the user's default postgress database.
* Enforce one database per document - ask for a new database name 
  when creating a new document instead of allowing the user 
  to choose an existing database.
* When there is still only one table, open it without asking the 
  user to choose a table, as if it is the default table.
* Show the database title in the window title bar, instead of 
  the filename.
(Murray Cumming)
* Fix an internationalization build problem. (Mike Castle)
* Added translations: 
  - Gujarati (Ankit Patel)
  - Punjabi (Amanpreet Singh Alam)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)
  - Turkish (Baris Cicek)

0.8.8:

* Details Layout: Simpler, hierarchical layout. This allows 
  more complex layouts, and allows fields to appear more than 
  once on the same layout.
* Documentation: Added user manual, though it looks a 
  bit strange in yelp at the moment.
* Relationships:
  - Avoid crash when fields of differerent types are used in
  relationships.
  - Actually delete relationships when the delete button is pressed.

0.8.7:

* Field Definition:
  - Add Boolean field type, which is displayed as a checkbox.
  - Default values can be the result of python calculations.
  - Default values are validated according to the field type.
* Pressing cancel on the initial dialog closes the application.
* Details view:
  - Corrected widget layout problems.
  - Do not lose the layout groups after a while.
  - Fix crash when changing user level, with related records.
(Murray Cumming)
* Added Albanian translation. (Laurent Dhima)
  
0.8.6:

* Creating new documents works again.
* Auto-save documents, when in developer mode, 
  instead of asking.
* Navigation:
  - Database: Default to the linux user name.
  - Tables: Show the hidden status correctly.
* MIME type registration: Use both old and new system, 
  as needed by GNOME 2.6.
* Allow a file to be specified on the command line.
* Removed useless toolbar.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added French translation. (Christophe Merlet)

0.8.5:

* Data Details: Editing works again.
* Find mode now works, though it's simple.
* Edit buttons are now stock Open buttons.
* Renaming of tables: The new names are stored in the 
  document so you can rename again, and use the renamed table.
  (Murray Cumming)

0.8.4:

* Connection dialog: The connect button is now activated when you press return in the password entry.
* Data Details: Groups of fields are now shown together in a HIG-style frame.
* Design: field, table, and layout group titles now have defaults, by replacing white space and 
  capitalizing.
* Some build improvements.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added Portugese translation (Duarte Loreto)
* Added British English translation (Gareth Owen)

0.8.3:

* Design:
  - Fields: Fix crash when opening the edit dialog.
  - Relationships: Fix editing, and actually save the relationships.
* Beginnings of user documentation.
* Updated German translation (Hendrik Brandt)

0.8.2:

* Navigation / Tables : Fixed focus bug when adding tables.
* Fields can lookup their values from a field in 
  another table via a relationship.
* When a table is marked as the default then it will be 
  opened automatically when the database is opened.
* Tables can now be renamed.
* List and Data views: Auto-increment fields are non-editable.
* Update the Data view when field editing has finished.
* Code cleanup: AddDel widget is now iterator-based.
(Murray Cumming)
* Czech translation. (Miloslav Trmac)
* Dutch translation. (Tino Meinen)
  

0.8.1:

* Details and List views: Dates, times, and numbers are now displayed 
  and parsed according to the current locale.
  (Murray Cumming, Daniel Elstner)
* Removed Design Mode - Added items to the Developer menu instead.
* Details view: The entry widgets for Date, time, and number fields now 
  have more suitable widths, so it looks nicer.
* User Level is now per-document (or per-instance) instead of per-application.
* The User Level is forced to Operator if the document is read-only.
* Do not show the help text because it's annoying.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added internationalization support, with the following translations:
  Italian (Alberto Paro)
  German (Hendrik Brandt)
  Canadian English (Adam Weinberger)
  Brazilian Portugese (Gustavo Noronha Silva)
  Swedish (Christian Rose)


0.8.0:

* Now uses Postgres instead of MySQL, due to the MySQL license changes.
* Now uses libgda instead of mysqlcppapi.
* Now use libglademm to allow more improvement of the UI.
* Glom can no longer be used with database tables that it did not create.
* Now uses only a small set of simple field types.
* Added "User Level" - normal operators do not see design functionality.
  User Levels are bad, but this seems to be the only way to present the 
  design functionality next to the stuff being designed.
* Allows simple layout of List and Details views. (grouping in the Details view is not yet fully implemented)
* Saves all field information in the document.
* Tables can be hidden from normal users.


0.7.0:

* Updated for latest mysqlcppapi 2 API.
* Various document-saving fixes.
  (by requiring the latest Bakery)
* Data Mode:

    - Human-readable field titles are now saved properly.
      (by requiring the latest libxml++)
    - The Field Details dialog closes when you click [Save].
