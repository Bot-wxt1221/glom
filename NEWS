* The Field Layout Properties dialog (right-click on a field in 
  developer mode to see the menu) now allows you to choose a custom title 
  for the field for this instance, in case the regular field title is not 
  appropriate. This is often the case for related fields.

  - Czech (Miloslav Trmac)
  - German (Hendrik Brandt)
  - Spanish (Francisco Javier F. Serrador)

0.9.0:

* Remembers last-viewed record and layout: If you view a record, then go 
  to another table, then come back, the same record will be shown, on the 
  same layout.
* Table title is now big and bold.

  averages, and counts.
  - Group By parts may now show extra "secondary" 
  fields, in addition to the field by which the records are 
  grouped.

  dialog window.
* Added simple reports functionality, via the Reports 
  menu.

0.8.26:

* For new databases, really allow the developer to create 
  and edit records. This has probably been broken since 
  the user administration was added.

  - Allow a drop-down list of choices for a field.
    Either a custom list, such as Mr, Ms, Mrs, Miss, 
    or a list of related records, such as a list of 
    product codes. This is demonstrated in the 
    example, in the Invoices table.
- Details layout: Fields are now editable by default.
* Fixed various leaks and crashes, improved 
  performance, and simplified the code some more.

0.8.22:

* Field Definitions:
  - Do not save empty default values as "NULL" or 0.
  - Prevent crash when opening Field details a second 
    time.
  - Allow saving when the default value changes.

* List: Do lookups, and refresh related fields, when 
  adding new records, not only when changing existing 
  records.
* Details and Lists Layout: Field formatting is now in a 
  separate dialog window.
* Boring Internals:
  - The List view's TreeModel now gets the data from the 
  database dynamically on-demand, though it probably 
  needs some more work to do that as efficiently as 
  possible.
  - Now depends on pygtk and gnome-python-extras/libgda.
* Translations:
  Updated: Candadian English (Adam Weinberger),
  German (Hendrik Brandt), Czech (Miloslav Trmac) 

0.8.20:

* Fix the boost::python build problem.
* Added highly experimental File/Print menu item. It 
  does stuff in the Details view. It should open some 
  HTML in your browser. glom installs an XSLT file 
  used to create the HTML, so feel free to improve it.
* Translations: Added Kinyarwanda translation. (Steve Murphy)

0.8.19:

* List and Details: When defining the layout, developers
  can specify numeric formatting, such as decimal places,
  and currency symbols.

  the developer group.
* Details view: You can now right-click on a field to add
  a field, group, or related records.

* Relationships:
  -  Allow the developer to specify whether related records 
  should be created automatically.
  - Do not clear the To Field column when the user clicks on it.
* Details/List views:
  - Automatic creation of related records:
  When you enter a value in a related field, when their is 
  not yet a key value to identify the related record, a 
  record can be create automatically, and the key value 
  will be filled in for you.
  - Developers may set fields on the layout as non-editable.


0.8.15:

* Related Fields:
  Details and List views can now show fields from related records.
  Just choose the relationship when you choose the field on 
  the layout. This even works in Related Records portals.

  When choosing a field for a layout, you can specify whether 
  editing of the field should be allowed.
* Dialogs are more HIG-compliant, using secondary text.
* Now requires gtkmm 2.6 instead of 2.4.

0.8.14:

* Details View: Adding records works even when a field appears
  more than once in the layout.
* List View: Deleting records works again.

0.8.13:

* Details:
  - Related Records now work, including automatic addition of new 
    related records.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on fields to choose a 
    different field.
  - In developer mode, you can right-click on related records to 
    choose a different relationship and choose the fields to show.
  - Groups may now contain the same field more than once.
* Details and List: Automatically-generated primary keys do not 
  need to be displayed.
* List: Avoid GTK+ warning when clicking on empty space in the 
  TreeView.
* Example:
  - Make some fields lookup their data from relationships:
    Invoice Lines gets product information from the products table,
    and Invoices looksup the customer name from the contacts table.
  - Warn if people recreate a database on the server from a 
    read-only example file, because they will probably want to 
    change things.

0.8.12:

* Postgres connection:
  - Really use the template1 database when creating new databases.
  - Slightly better error handling.
* Obscure internals:
  - Use a custom GdaValue-based treemodel for the List view,

  - Connect to the template1 database when creating new databases, 
    because recent (?) versions of postgres require this.
  - Don't ignore the host name.
  - Added postgres_setup.txt and a non-libgda test to help 
    investigate connection problems.
  - Share connections more, without re-connecting, to increase speed.
* List Layout:
  - Fix bug that prevented data entry of fields that have 
    human-readable titles.
* Layout Design:
  - Fix loss of layout groups when loading.
  - Allow adding of related records (half-finished) in the 
    middle of the layout, and no longer show them automatically 
    in a notebook.
    (It's really time to make this feel like glade.)
* Navigation:
  - Show table titles instead of name when in Operator mode.
* Build:
  - Distribute the intltool files.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Cezar)
  - #include libintl.h in more files, required on some systems.
    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162932 (Mike Castle)

* When there is still only one table, open it without asking the 
  user to choose a table, as if it is the default table.
* Show the database title in the window title bar, instead of 
  the filename.
(Murray Cumming)

  bit strange in yelp at the moment.
* Relationships:
  - Avoid crash when fields of differerent types are used in
  relationships.
