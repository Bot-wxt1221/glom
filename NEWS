0.8.1:

* Removed Design Mode - Added items to the Developer menu instead.
* Details and List views: Dates, times, and numbers are now displayed 
  and parsed according to the current locale.


0.8.0:

* Now uses Postgres instead of MySQL, due to the MySQL license changes.
* Now uses libgda instead of mysqlcppapi.
* Now use libglademm to allow more improvement of the UI.
* Glom can no longer be used with database tables that it did not create.
* Now uses only a small set of simple field types.
* Added "User Level" - normal operators do not see design functionality.
  User Levels are bad, but this seems to be the only way to present the 
  design functionality next to the stuff being designed.

* Saves all field information in the document.
* Tables can be hidden from normal users.
