Each distro has a different default configuration for Postgres. These notes should help you to make postgres work with Glom. If you can improve this advice, then do tell us.


*** Fedora Core 3:

** To create a user that can create databases:

[murrayc@localhost]$ su
Password:
[root@localhost docs]# su postgres
bash-3.00$ createuser
Enter name of user to add: murrayc
Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) y
CREATE USER
bash-3.00$


** Allowing access:

As root, edit
/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

Change
#tcpip_socket = false
to
tcpip_socket = true


As root, edit
/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf:

Uncomment the 2 existing host lines:

# IPv4-style local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
# IPv6-style local connections:
host    all         all         ::1               ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff        trust

Add this:

# Upstream default configuration
#
# The following configuration is the upstream default, which allows
# unrestricted access to amy database by any user on the local machine.
# 
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        IP-ADDRESS        IP-MASK           METHOD
#
local   all         all                                             trust
# IPv4-style local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
