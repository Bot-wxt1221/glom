Each distro has a different default configuration for Postgres. These notes should help you to make postgres work with Glom. If you can improve this advice, then do tell us.




** Creating the user.

[1] To create a user that can create databases:

[murrayc@localhost]$ su
Password:
[root@localhost]# su postgres
  (Or "sudo su postgres" on Ubuntu)

bash-3.00$ createuser -P
  (-P means "assign password")
Enter name of user to add: murrayc
Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) y
CREATE USER
bash-3.00$


** Allowing access:

As root, edit
/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf
  (In Fedora Core 3)
or
/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf:
  (In Debian and Ubuntu

Change
#tcpip_socket = false
to
tcpip_socket = true
(Debian and Ubuntu seem to have this already, but Fedora sets it to false by default.)


As root, edit
/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf:
  (In Fedora Core 3)
or
/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf:
  (In Debian and Ubuntu)

Uncomment the 2 existing host lines:

# IPv4-style local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1         255.255.255.255   trust
# IPv6-style local connections:
host    all         all         ::1               ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff        trust
